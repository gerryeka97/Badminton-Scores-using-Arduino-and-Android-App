Welcome to the project repository for the Badminton Match Score Recording system! This project allows you to track and display the score of a badminton match in real-time, using an Arduino board and an application interface. The system can be monitored and controlled via a mobile or desktop application, providing an intuitive way to manage match scores and keep track of gameplay. </br>
<ins>**Project Overview**</ins> </br>
The goal of this project is to provide a simple and effective solution for tracking badminton match scores. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller connected to a display that shows the current score. Additionally, an application allows users to monitor and control the score remotely. This is ideal for tournaments, casual matches, or any scenario where score tracking is required without manual intervention. </br>
<ins>**Features**</ins></br>
Real-Time Score Tracking: Keep track of both player's scores during the match. </br>
Arduino Integration: Uses an Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno) to control the scoring display.</br>
Monitorable via Application: Remote monitoring and control of the score through a custom application (mobile).</br>
Easy Setup: Simple wiring and code configuration for Arduino.</br>
<ins>**Components**</ins>
**Hardware:** </br>
Arduino Mega WiFi R3 ATmega2560 ESP8266 (or any compatible Arduino board) </br>
P10 LED or LCD Display (e.g., 16x2 LCD, 7-segment LED display, etc.) </br>
Buttons/Sensors for player score increment </br>
Wires & Breadboard for circuit setup </br>
**Software:** </br>
Arduino IDE for uploading code to the Arduino </br>
Application (i used java but it could also be built using frameworks like React Native, Electron, or even Python) </br>
Serial Communication to interface Arduino with the application </br>
